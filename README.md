This is the homework 2

The challenging part of the home work is actually the PLNT tricker. It throw out the divided by 0 error for me to find out it's actually 
can start from the middle of the year or even didn't list anything in the whole year. 

To avoid all the 0s and still able to pick the open price even it will start at the middle of the year, I set up conditions in my code to 
accomodate these scenarios. 

The code is robust for any situation I described above. Becasue it's not always looking for 0101 and 1231, it's actually find the real start and the close date

I have sorted the ticker and the date before running the code, so it's avoid the unnecessary loopoings and improve the efficienies.

Thank you
